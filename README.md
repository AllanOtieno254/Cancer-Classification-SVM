# Cancer Classification using SVM

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying cancer types based on features extracted from cell samples using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for model training and predictions.
- `models/`: Contains the saved SVM model for making predictions.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and modeling.
- `src/`: Scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and making predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: Required packages for the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `LICENSE`: License information.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing can be found in the `data/` folder. Ensure that the feature columns are properly formatted for predictions.
